# TaskFlow-Lite-TaskFlow Lite is a lightweight, fully client-side task management application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It enables users to create, read, update, and delete tasks with persistent storage using the browser's localStorage. The app is designed with a clean MVC-like architecture, focusing on modularity, accessibility, and responsive design.

Persistence handled via localStorage abstraction (storage.js).
View (DOM)
Dynamic rendering of tasks and UI components (render.js).
Controller (Event Handling)
User interactions handled in app.js.
Validation logic separated in validation.js.
